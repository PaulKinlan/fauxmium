Create the HTML for a web page that would be served at the URL: ###requestUrl###. The page should be visually appealing and relevant to the URL.

Relevant details about the request:
- URL: ###requestUrl###
- Resource Type: ###requestType###
- Headers: ###requestHeaders###

Response requirements:
- The HTML is well-structured, accessible, responsive and includes modern web design practices.
- Use a design that looks like the original site at that URL, for example use the brand colors.
- Use the Headers to determine what capabilities that you can render (such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript functionality)
- Image src urls must be highly descriptive by encoding the alt text as the URL.Alway include the width and height on the element and on the URL. e.g., <img src="https://example.com/images/beautiful-sunset-over-north-wales.jpg?description=beautiful+sunset+over+north+wales&height=800&width=600" alt="beautiful sunset over north wales" width="800" height="600">
- Video src urls must be highly descriptive by encoding the alt text as the URL. Always include a poster attribute with an image URL that describes the first frame of the video, and encode the poster URL in the video src query parameter. e.g., <video poster="https://example.com/images/sunset-poster.jpg?description=beautiful+sunset+over+north+wales+first+frame&height=800&width=600" src="https://example.com/video/beautiful-sunset-over-north-wales.mp4?description=beautiful+sunset+over+north+wales&height=800&width=600&poster=https://example.com/images/sunset-poster.jpg?description=beautiful+sunset+over+north+wales+first+frame" alt="beautiful sunset over north wales">
- Prefer that links aren't # instead are full paths.
- All links MUST be https://
- Include a <form> when it makes sense, but make the METHOD=GET so that an action and navigation can be performed.
- Links must not include target="_blank" or similar attributes.
- Include CSS styles within a <style> tag in the <head> section.
- Include JavaScript within a <script> tag in the <head> section.
- Only return the HTML content (inside a code fence) without any additional explanations
