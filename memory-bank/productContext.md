# Product Context

This document explains why the Fauxmium project exists, the problems it solves, and how it should work from a user's perspective.

## Problem Statement

- The traditional web is vast but finite. Generative AI offers the potential to create an infinite, dynamic, and personalized web experience.
- Exploring the web can be passive. Fauxmium aims to create a more interactive and surprising browsing experience where every link leads to new, AI-generated content.

## User Experience Goals

- The user should be able to launch the Fauxmium browser and navigate to any URL, real or imagined.
- The browser should generate and display a plausible HTML page for the requested URL.
- Images within the generated pages should also be AI-generated and relevant to the context.
- The user should be aware that the content is not real and is being generated by AI. An initial warning screen is provided for this purpose.
