# Active Context

This document tracks the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps. It also captures active decisions, important patterns, and project insights.

## Current Focus

- **Initial Project Analysis and Documentation**: The primary focus is on understanding the existing codebase and populating the memory bank with accurate and comprehensive documentation.

## Recent Changes

- **Populated Memory Bank**: All memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md`) have been updated with information gathered from the source code and project files.

## Next Steps

- **Address Limitations**: The next phase of development should focus on addressing the known limitations of the project:
  - Implement CSS and JavaScript generation to create more realistic and interactive web pages.
  - Introduce a state management system to maintain context between navigations.
  - Improve the image generation process by providing more context about the image's placement and the surrounding content.
