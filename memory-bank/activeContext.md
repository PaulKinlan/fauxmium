# Active Context

This document tracks the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps. It also captures active decisions, important patterns, and project insights.

## Current Focus

- **Chrome Extension Development**: The current focus is on building a Chrome extension to display session costs.

## Recent Changes

- **Created Chrome Extension**: A new Chrome extension has been created in the `extension` directory. The extension fetches and displays cost data from the `/cost` API endpoint. The extension is loaded using the `--load-extension` flag, and the server configuration is passed to it via the Chrome DevTools Protocol's `Extensions.setStorageItems` method. The extension has been updated to correctly parse the cost data and display it in a user-friendly format.
- **Populated Memory Bank**: All memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md`) have been updated with information gathered from the source code and project files.

## Next Steps

- **Address Limitations**: The next phase of development should focus on addressing the known limitations of the project:
  - Implement CSS and JavaScript generation to create more realistic and interactive web pages.
  - Introduce a state management system to maintain context between navigations.
  - Improve the image generation process by providing more context about the image's placement and the surrounding content.
